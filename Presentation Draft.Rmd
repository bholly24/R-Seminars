## An Overview

- Using R, R studio and a good R workflow
- The benefits of R 
- Basic R actions and data types
- A useful R shortcuts

## R

- R is a free, open-source  programming language built on the S language, which was developed by AT&Ts Bell labs in the 1970s. 
- R was released in its current form in the 90s
- It's used primarily for statistics, data analysis, and graphing
- R is a functional programming language

## Why use R?
- Free
- Reproducible
- Considered one of the best graphing programs
- Additional packages provide more functionality than plenty of paid software; often new methods are implemented here first!
- Functionality: create your own functions!


## Understanding R Studio's layout
Four panes:  

1. Source: R scripts  

2. Console: Where the scripts are run  

3. Enviornment: The area where saved data and variables are stored  

4. Files and plots: The area where plots appear and files in the same folder can be viewed  

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("studio.png")

```

## R Scripts

- The record of your work
- Try and keep the script organized. You want to be able to rerun it without errors
- It's useful to include comments if you're doing something important or complicated and you want to remember why you did it later

```{r eval=FALSE}
# I'm dropping values greater than 10 because they are outliers

filter(df, x < 10)

```

## Start a New Project
- Every time you start a new class or you're analyzing new data, make a new R Project!
- R projects are a great way to organize your work
- Put the data files you will use in the same folder as the R project folder

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("project.png")

```

## Importing data

- R can handle importing basically any data type!
- Basic format: read("data_name.csv")
- Easiest: If the data is in your project folder, import from there!

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
knitr::include_graphics("import.png")

```

## Best Practice

- Copy the code from this panel and put it at the start of your R script

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width= 10, fig}
knitr::include_graphics("import_two.png")

```

## Examining your data

- str gives an overview of the type of each variable as well as the first couple of rows

```{r}

data(mtcars)

str(mtcars)

```

## Examining your data

- View(mtcars) opens up a new window that you can scroll through the data

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width= 10, fig.height=8}

data(mtcars)

knitr::include_graphics("view.png")

```

## Assigning a variable name

- Use the assignemnt operator <- to name something
- c is used to combine multiple values

```{r}

ages <- c(18, 24, 89, 6)

```

## Data types
There are four major data types and most functions require the data is a certain type.

1. Character variables
2. Double variables
3. Logical variables
4. Factors

## Data types 

- Character values are surrounded by quotes " "
- You can use is.character to check your variable is the right type

```{r}

characters <- c("dogs", "cats", "trust")

is.character(characters)

```

## Double variables

- Numeric variables, which can accept integers or numeric data (with a decimal)

```{r}

numbers <- c(3, 6, 9, 53)

is.numeric(numbers)

```

- If you ask if numbers is type character
```{r}

is.character(numbers)

```

## Logical variables

```{r}

logical <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

is.logical(logical)

```

##  Factors

- Factors (ordinal variables)

```{r}

factor <- factor(c("Agree", "Neutral", "Disagree"))

is.factor(factor)

```

- To see the levels of a factor:
```{r}

levels(factor)

```

## Mixing data types

- If you data types are mixed, R will choose one
```{r}

mixed_types <- c(12, 5, 3, "horse")

typeof(mixed_types)

```
## Missing Data
- NA is recorded if there is no data for that observation
- Most functions won't run if you have NAs in your data
- There are lots of ways to remove NAs, but you want to make sure you understand why they are there in the first place
```{r}
data <- c(NA, 8, 2, 5)

sum(data)

data_omit <- na.omit(data)

sum(data_omit)
```

## How to name in R
- Shorter is better
- Be descriptive (i.e. don't name things data or model)
- Don't include spaces or other weird characters
- I prefer using snake case for variables

```{r}
# Good (snake case)
trust_values <- c(0, 0, 0)

# Also good (camel case)
trustValues <- c(0, 0, 0)

#Bad
"Trust Values" <- c(0, 0, 0)

```

## Simplest data structures
- A vector is a single variable, with every value of the same type
- Data frames are a group of variables. They can be different types but they must all be the same length!

```{r}
vector <- c(3, 5, 6)

vector_two <- c("dog", "cat", "mouse")

data_frame <- data.frame(one = vector, two = vector_two)

str(data_frame)

```

## Installing and loading a package

```{r}

#install.packages("tidyverse")

library(tidyverse)

```

## A graphing shortcut!
- ggplot2 is the premier R graphing package but it can be slightly hard to start out with
- R add-on "esquisse" can be used to make graphs using point and click commands
- Install the package and try it out
